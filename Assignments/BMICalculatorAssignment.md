# Assignment: BMI Calculator
In this assignment, you will be writing a program to calculate BMI from
inputted weight and height measurements.  GitHub Classroom will be used for
assignment repositories.  Look for announcement in Sakai with link.  The
created repository will be empty.  Create a README.md file in GitHub first.
That will allow for this new repository to be cloned to your local computer.

### Program specifications
* Receives input from the user from the console  
   + Console input can be received with code such as follows:   
   `x = input("Enter number: ")`  
   Note that `x` will be a string and needs to be converted to a float.  
   + Weight input must be in pounds  
   + Height input must be in inches
   
* Program must output to the console the calculated BMI.  
   + Console output can be achieved by code such as:
   `print("The number entered was {}".format(x))`
   
* Program must output whether the calculated BMI represents underweight,
normal weight, overweight, or obese.

* Extra credit:  give the user the option to enter weight in kilograms and 
height in meters.

### Approach
* Clone GitHub Classroom repository to your computer
* Create feature branch for new feature to be added (e.g., data input)
* Use meaningful commit messages and an appropriate frequency of commits while
developing features.
* Push developed feature branch to GitHub.
* In GitHub, create a Pull request to merge the feature branch into the 
master branch.
* Merge the pull request into master branch.
* Do not delete any of the feature branches.
* Pull the newly merged master branch back to your local repository so changes
to master branch are captured locally.
* Repeat for other features
* Create a `README.md` file to explain how to run and use your program.
* When the assignment is completed, create an annotated git tag called `v1.0.0`
on your master branch to indicate your final submission.
* If you make additional changes after creating this tag, simply create another
tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`).  We will grade whatever the most recent submission is.
* Make sure your final submission is pushed to GitHub, merged into the
master branch, and tagged before the deadline.


### Grading Criteria
* Good use of `git` workflow  
    + Meaningful commit messages and appropriate number of commits  
    + Use of feature branches when adding new functionality
    + Using Pull Requests for merging feature branches into master branch
    + All branches and final code pushed to GitHub
    + Use of a git tag
* Python Fundamentals
    + Modular code
    + Code executes without errors
    + Code meets specifications given above
* Presence and content of README.md file
