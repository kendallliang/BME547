# Docstrings

Docstrings are used to annotate functions to provide:
* One-line summary of function
* More verbose description of function
* Input parameters
* What is returned

Relevant Python documentation: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

There are three common docstring styles that can be used:
* [reStructuredText Docstring Format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/)
* [Numpy Style Python Docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
* [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

`reStructuredText` docstrings are the "default" for most IDEs and code editors,
but it can be difficult to read (IMO).  Numpy and Google-style docstring tend
to be more readable in "raw" form, and can be easily compiled into full
documentation using the
[Napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
[Sphinx](sphinx.md) extension.

## Style Examples
### reStructured Text
```
def BMI_calculation(height, weight):
    """Calculate Body Mass Index from given height and weight
    
    Body Mass Index (BMI) attempts to quantify the amount of tissue mass in
    an individual and then categorize that person as underweight, normal,
    overweight or obese.  The formula for BMI is
    BMI = (mass in kg) / (height in m)^2

    :param height: float containing the height in meters
    :param weight: float containing the weight in kilograms

    :returns: float containing the calculated BMI
