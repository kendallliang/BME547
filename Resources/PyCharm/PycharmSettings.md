# Useful Settings for PyCharm

### Accessing the Settings Window
* Windows:  File/Settings...
* Mac:  Look for Preferences menu item

### Tools / Python Integrated Tools
* Can set the "Default test runner"
* Can set Docstring format
* Can set the Package requirements file name if you prefer to use a different
file than requirements.txt

### Project / Project Interpreter
* Displays and controls virtual environment
* "+" allows you to add packages
 
### Editor/Inspections
* Controls what the editor will display in terms of errors, warnings, etc.
* PEP8 coding style violations is an option you can select under the Python
section on the right-hand side of the window.
* NOTE:  `pytest --pep8` will have the final word on whether PEP-8 style is
achieved.  So, do not rely only on PyCharm to check for this.

### Editor / Code Style / Python
* Allows users to change settings in how the editor formats python code and 
gives some errors.  
  + Be careful if you change any of these settings.  For this class, the 
  `pytest --pep8` program will be the final word on whether PEP-8 style is 
  achieved.
  
### Editor / Code Style
* Can set line length using "Hard wrap at"
